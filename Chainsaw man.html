        <p style="color: white">Chainasaw Man (Japanese: チェンソーマン, Hepburn: Chensō Man) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki
        Fujimoto. Its first part was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December
        2018 to December 2020; its second part began serialization in Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ online magazine in
        July 2022. Its chapters have been collected in 12 tankōbon volumes as of October 2022. Chainsaw Man follows
        the story of Denji, an impoverished young man who makes a contract that fuses his body with that of a
        dog-like devil named Pochita, granting him the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Denji
        eventually joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on fighting against devils
        whenever they become a threat to the world.

        In North America, the manga is licensed in English by Viz Media, for both print and digital release, and it
        is also published by Shueisha on the Manga Plus online platform. An anime television series adaptation
        produced by MAPPA premiered in October 2022.

        As of October 2022, the manga had over 18 million copies in circulation. In 2021, it won the 66th Shogakukan
        Manga Award in the shōnen category and won the Harvey Awards in the Best Manga category in 2021 and 2022.
        Chainsaw Man has been overall well received by critics, who have commended its storytelling and characters,
        and have particularly highlighted its violent scenes within the context of the story.</p>
